# Please do Not
...push changes you do not understand and could cause harm (especially if you installed a plugin or made changes to the package.json)

# Install instructions
be sure to be in the root folder and you've got node installed 

now (in the terminal) type:

npm i 
cd frontend
npm i
cd ..
npm run dev

Note! npm run dev will start both the backend server and the frontend 
you are basically done now.

Happy coding
